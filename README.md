# 📝 Task Management Web App

A modern, full-stack Kanban-style task management app with smart workload balancing, secure JWT authentication, and a responsive, professional UI.

---

## 🚀 Features

✅ **Role-Based Permissions**
- The **assigner** of a task can edit or delete it.
- The **assignee** can only change the task's status (*In Progress*, *Done*), but cannot edit task details.

✅ **Smart Assign**
- Automatically assigns new tasks to the user with the **fewest active tasks**, balancing workload smartly.

✅ **Task Editing & Conflict Resolution**
- Edit tasks in a sleek modal.
- If edits conflict with server data, a user-friendly conflict resolver helps merge changes.

✅ **JWT Authentication**
- Secure authentication and role-based access control via JSON Web Tokens.

✅ **Real-Time Updates**
- Tasks and activity logs update live across all clients with **Socket.io**.

✅ **Responsive, Custom UI**
- Mobile-friendly with custom CSS and smooth animations.
