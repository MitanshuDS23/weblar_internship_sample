# Task Management Web App

A modern, full-stack Kanban-style task management app with smart workload balancing, secure JWT authentication, and a responsive, professional UI.

---

## Features

- **Role-Based Permissions**  
  - The assigner of a task can edit or delete it.  
  - The assignee can only change the task's status (In Progress, Done), but cannot edit task details.

- **Smart Assign**  
  - Automatically assigns new tasks to the user with the fewest active tasks, balancing workload smartly.

- **Task Editing & Conflict Resolution**  
  - Edit tasks in a sleek modal.  
  - If edits conflict with server data, a user-friendly conflict resolver helps merge changes.

- **JWT Authentication**  
  - Secure authentication and role-based access control via JSON Web Tokens.

- **Real-Time Updates**  
  - Tasks and activity logs update live across all clients with Socket.io.

- **Responsive, Custom UI**  
  - Mobile-friendly with custom CSS and smooth animations.
